# mttmzr/capri-starter-react

A community starter template for the [Capri](https://capri.build) static site generator featuring:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
- JSX instead of TSX
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- a custom directory structure

This template is heavily based on the original React template by Capri.

## Usage

Use the `Use this template` button or just clone this repo and remove the .git directory, then `npm i`

Theoretically, you should be able to use this community template when generating a new capri site, but I really had no luck with:

```sh
npm init capri my-capri-site -- -e mttmzr/capri-starter-react
```
